# SQL Notes with Database Codes:

## All Exercises and Tasks from Odin and CCBP SQLite

### Create Database

```sql
create database database_name;
```

```sql
use database database_name;
```

## Data types

* int
* float
* varchar()
* decimal(p,s)
* time
* date
* datetime
* char()

### Create Table

```sql
create table table_name1(
    column_name1 datatype contraints,
    column_name2 datatype contraints,
    column_name3 datatype contraints,
    foreign key(column_name3) references table_name2(column_name of table_name2) on delete cascade
    constraint contrain_name check(age>18)
    );
```

Contraints are:
---------------

* Primary Key - Not Null,Not Empty, No Duplicates
* Unique Key - No Duplicates but, May Null or Not Null
* Foreign Key
* Composite Key
* Candidate Key
* Check
* Default
* Auto_Increment
* Not Null

`Note:`Can be created after table creation also by using `alter table commad`

Indexes:

* Primary Key Index
* Unique Key Index
* Composite Key Index
* Full-Text Index
* Clustered Index
* Non-Clustered Index
* B-Tree

### Insert Rows

```sql
insert into table_name
      (column_name1,column_name2,...)
values(value1,value2,....),
      (value3,value4,....);
```

### Retrieving Data From Table

```sql
select * from table_name;
```

```sql
select a.* from table_name a;
```

```sql
select * from database_name.table_name;
```

```sql
select column_name1,column_name2,... 
from table_name;
```

```sql
describe table_name;
```

```sql
show tables;
```

### Update Rows

```sql
update table_name
set column_name1=value1
where condition;
```

### Delete Rows

```sql
delete from table_name
where conditon;
```

```sql
drop table table_name;
```

```sql
truncate table table_name;
```

### Alter Table - Insert Columns and Renam Columns

Adding Columns

```sql
alter table table_name
add column_name data_type;
```

Rename Columns

```sql
alter table table_name
rename column_name1=column_name2;
```

Delete Column

```sql
alter table table_name
drop column_name1;
```

## Creating Indexes using Alter

```sql 
show indexes from table_name;
```
```sql
create [unique] index index_name
on table_name (column1, column2, ...);
```

```sql
alter table table_name
add [unique] index index_name (column1, column2, ...);
```

```sql
alter table table_name
drop index index_name
```

## Querying in SQL and SQL Query Optimisation:

Avoid using function

Ex: In Like `%` in begining scans entire table
Ex: use Innerjoin,union,order by,upper,distinct,give specified columns in select

### Comparsion Operators

1. =
2. />
3. /<
4. <>
5. />=
6. /<=

## Functions

### Date,Time,Year,Month,Leap Year - YYYY-MM-DD | HH:MM:SS

1. Date(date_expression) - date only
2. Month(date_expression) - month only
3. Year(date_expression) - year only
4. Now() - current time only
5. Hour()

select * from regx_table where column_name regexp 'i'; --contains i
select * from regx_table where column_name regexp '[i]';  --contains i
select * from regx_table where not column_name regexp '[i]'; --not contains -i
select * from regx_table where column_name not regexp 'i'; --not contains i
select * from regx_table where column_name regexp '^i'; -- starts with i

select * from regx_table where not column_name regexp '^i'; --not starts with i
select * from regx_table where column_name regexp '^[^i]'; --not starts with i
select * from regx_table where column_name regexp '[^i]'; --doubt / must produce strings not contains i
select * from regx_table where column_name regexp '[^0-9]'; --doubt / must produce strrings not contains digits 0-9
select * from regx_table where column_name regexp '[0-9]'; --contains digit

```

Ex-2:

```sql
where name like "%Ram%"; -- Contains Ram
where not name like "%Ram%"; -- Contains Ram
where name like "Ram%"; -- Starts with Ram
where name like "%Ram"; -- Ends with Ram
where name like "a_%"; -- Starts with 'a' followed by 'one' letter, ends with others
```

### Logical Operators

1. AND
2. OR
3. NOT

### In,Not In, Between, Exists, All

```sql
where brand in ("Puma","Nike");
```

```sql
where price between 15 and 100;
```

`Note:` 15 and 100 Included

### Order by and Distinct

```sql
order by asc/desc
```

### Pagination - Offset and Limit

## Aggregations

1. Count() - Count Number of Rows on Specified Condition i.e Where Clause
2. Sum()
3. Min()
4. Max()
5. Avg()

`Note:` Sequence is Aggregation > Where > Group by > Having

Here where can be used to filter results based on columns name

But having is used to filter from present query from `select * from table_name;`

Count(*) is completely based on Where clause

### Alias

### Group by and Having

With Roll up = Sub Total of Column

1. Group by Column_name1,Column_name `with roll up`;
2. Having Condition;

## Common Concepts

Select Clause

```sql
select film,(collection-budget) as profit 
from table_name;
```

Where Clause

```sql
select film 
from table_name
where (collection-budget)>50;
```

Having Clause

```sql
select film 
from table_name
group by 1
having (collection-budget)>100;
```

## `Case` Clause

Syntax:

```sql
select column_name1, column_name2
case
    when condition1 then value1
    when condition2 then value2
    ...
    else value
    end as `column_name3`
from table_name;
```

In Aggregations:

```sql
select count(case when rating >= 8 then 1 end) as above_eight,
       count(case when rating <  8 then 1 end) as below_eight
from table_name;
```
```sql 
select sum(case when dpet_id=80 then 1 else 0 end) as dept80_count,
       sum(case when dpet_id=90 then 1 else 0 end) as dept80_count,
       sum(case when dpet_id=10 then 1 else 0 end) as dept80_count,
       sum(case when dpet_id=60 then 1 else 0 end) as dept80_count
from employees;
```
```sql 
select dept_id,count(*) as Emp_count,
        case when count(Emp_id) >=30 then 'Large_Dept'
        else 'Small_Dept' end as Dept_cat
from employees where dept_id is not null
group by 1;
```

```sql
select id, name, salary, department,
    case
        when salary >= 10000 then 'A'
        when salary >= 8000 then 'B'
        when salary >= 6000 then 'C'
        else 'D'
    end as salary_grade
from employees;
```

### Case When used in alter and update clause

```sql 
alter table employees
add column salary_cat varchar(50);
```
```sql 
update employees
set salary_cat = case 
                    when salary > 6500 then 'High'
                    when slary <= 6500 then 'Low'
                    End;
```

## Set Operations

1. Intersect
2. Minus - `except`
3. Union - Unique Values, No Duplicates / Distinct
4. Union All - Duplicate Values Present Here

`Note:` order by, limit, offset can be used at the end of query
Syntax;

```sql
select c1, c2 from table_name 
set_operator
select c1, c2 from table_name 
```

## Joins and Joins with Aggregations

### Natural Join - Join

`Note:` Based on common columns

### Inner Join

`Note:` Inner join means intersection of two tables, this `intersection` is based on matching rows.

```sql
select * from table_name1
inner join table_name2 using(column_name1);
```

```sql
select * from t1
inner join t2 on t1.column_name1=t2.column_name2
where condition;
```

## Outer Joins

`Note:` Joins can be used in from clause also

### Left Join

`Note:` Left Join gives all rows from Left table and Non-Matching Rows will get `Null` values

### Right Join

`Note:` Right Join gives all rows from Right table and Non-Matching Rows will get `Null` values

### Full Join = Left Join + Right Join

### Cross Join

`Note:` In `Cross Join`, each row from the first table is combined with all rows in the second table.`Cross Join` is also called as `Cartesian Join`

If Table -1 has `3 Rows` and Table - 2 has `3 Rows` then Output Table - 3 has `9 Rows`

### Self Join

`Note:`We can also combine a table with itself. This kind of join is called `self-join`

Q1.Get student pairs who registered for common course.

```sql
select sc1.student_id as student_id1,sc2.student_id as student_id2, sc1.course_id
from student_course as sc1
inner join student_course sc2 on sc1.course_id = sc2.course_id
where sc1.student_id < sc2.student_id;
```

## Views

### Create View

```sql
create view view_name as
select c1,c2,...
from table_name;
```

### Querying View

```sql
select * from view_name;
```

### Delete View

```sql
drop view view_name;
```

### List All Views That Created

```sql
select name
from sqlite_master
where type = 'view';
```

In Co-relates subquery the `where` condition is linking to `outer query`

# Common Table Expression CTE

Its a `temporary result` set used with in single SQL statement.Like *define a subquery once and use it multiple times*

Syntax:

```sql
with cte_name as (
    select column1, column2, ...
    from table_name
    where condition
    )
select * from cte_name;
```

    select a.first_name, a.last_name from actor a
    inner join film_actor fa on a.actor_id = fa.actor_id
    inner join film f on f.film_id = fa.film_id
    where f.rating = 'pg'
    )
select * from actors_pg;
```

Q2.We want to find the average salary for each department, but exclude any departments where the average salary is less than 50,000.

```sql
with avg_salary as (
    select department, avg(salary) as avg_salary
    from employees
    group by department
    having avg_salary >= 50000
    )
select * from avg_salary;
```

Q3: Specific Department=30
```sql 
with department_30 as (select * from eployees where dept_id=30)
select emp_id,name,salary,dept_id from department_30;
```    

Q4. Hire_Month CTE with Join

```sql 
with hire_month as ( 
    select extract(month from hire_date) as month, employee_id
    from employees
    where employee_id=101
    );
select b.employee_id,b.first_name,b.hire_date
from employees b
join hire_month a on extract(month from b.hire_date)=a.month
where b.employee_id !=101;
```

# Recursive CTE;

CTE that refers to itself, creating a recursive loop

This is useful when you need to work with hierarchical data structures like trees or graphs etc

Steps:

1. Define the initial query that will be used to seed the CTE.

* This query should include the `anchor member`, which is the starting point for the recursion.

2. Define the recursive query that will be used to iterate over the CTE.

* This query should reference the CTE itself, and use a `UNION ALL` operator to combine the results of the previous iteration with the new results.

3. Define the termination condition for the recursion.

* This condition should be included in the `WHERE clause` of the recursive query, and should be based on the data in the CTE.

Ex-1: Use a recursive CTE to print a triangle of stars

```sql
with recursive cte as
  (
    select 1 as n, cast('*' as char(100)) as str -- Intial Query Step-1
    union all                                    -- union all
    select n + 1, concat('* ',str) from cte      -- Recursive Feature Step-2
    where n < 5                                  -- Termination Condition Step-3
  )
select str from cte;
```
Print Odd Number from 1 to 100

```sql 
with recursive numbers as (
    select 1 as nos
    union all
    select nos+1           -- change +1 to +2
    from numbers
    where nos < 100
    )
select * from numbers where mod(nos,2)=0;
```
Union     = No Duplicates
Union all = Duplicates

Check Engine Parts Hierachy Example;

Ex-1
```sql 
create table parts (
    part_id int primary key,
    part_name varchar(100),
    parent_part_id int,
    foreign key(parent_part_id) references parts(part_id)
);

insert into parts (part_id, part_name, parent_part_id)
values 
    (1, 'Engine', null),
    (2, 'Transmission', null),
    (3, 'Cylinder', 1),
    (4, 'Piston', 3),
    (5, 'Crankshaft', 1),
    (6, 'Gearbox', 2),
    (7, 'Gear', 6),
    (8, 'Clutch', 2),
    (9, 'Flywheel', 2),
    (10, 'Valve', 3);
    
select * from parts;
```
```sql 
with recursive parts_hierarchy as (
    select part_id,part_name,parent_part_id from parts
    where part_name = 'Engine'
    union all
    select p.part_id,p.part_name,p.parent_part_id from parts_heirarchy as ph
    join parts p on ph.part_id=p.parent_part_id
    )
select * from part_hierarchy;
```








# Views and Temporary Table

Syntax:

```sql
create view view_name as 
select column1, column2, ... 
from table_name 
where condition;
```

### Querying View

```sql
select * from view_name;
```

### Drop View

```sql
drop view view_name;
```

### Update View

```sql
update view_name set column1 = 'John' where id = 1;
```

`Limitations`: The view must not contain any aggregate functions (eg.sum(),count()...), group by clauses, union, join, or subqueries. for some SQL Packages

### Temporary Table

It exists during that database session or connection, dropped automatically when session closes.

Syntax:

```sql
create temporary table temp_table_name (id int, name varchar(50));
```

Syntax:

```sql
drop temporary table temp_table_name;
```

`Note:`These tables cann't shared or visible to other connections

Ex-1: Create a temporary table of films with rating as `NC-17` (use film table).

```sql
create temporary table temp;
select * from film 
where rating = 'nc-17';
```

```sql
select * from temp;  
```

We can perform all operations on temorary table once created.Like insert,alter,update..etc

# Stored Procedures

Creating a Stored Procedure in MySQL:

```sql 
show procedure status where db='database_name';
drop procedure procedure_name;   -- to delete procedures from database
```

Syntax:

```sql
create procedure procedure_name ([parameter_list])
begin
   -- SQL statements to perform the task
end;
```
```sql 
delimiter//
create procedure GetCustomerInfo(in customer_id int)
begin
select customer_id,first_name,last_name,email 
from customer
where customer_id=customer_id;
end //
delimiter ;
call GetCustomerInfo(1);
```
```sql 
delimiter //
create procedure Film_Details(in actorid int)
begin
select f.tiltle,a.first_name from film_actor fa
inner join film f on f.film_id=fa.film_id
inner join actor a on a.actor_id=fa.actor_id
where a.actor_id=actorid;
end // 
delimiter ;
call Film_Details(15)
```

```sql
call procedure_name([parameter_list]);
```

Ex-1:

```sql
create procedure GetAvgSalary (in dept_id int, out avg_salary decimal(10, 2))
begin
   select avg(salary) into avg_salary
   from employees
   where department_id = dept_id;
end;
```

```sql
call GetAvgSalary(1, @avg_salary);
```

This will calculate the average salary of employees in `department_id=1` and store the result in the `@avg_salary` variable.

Example-2: Create a procedure for odd numbers 1 to 10

```sql
delimiter //
create procedure while_loop()
begin
declare num int default 1;
declare res varchar(50);
set res = cast(num as char);
while num < 11 do
set num = num + 2;
set res = concat(res,',' , num);
end while;
select res;
end //
call while_loop();
```

# Normalisation

### 1NF:

A table is referred to as being in its First Normal Form if `Atomicity` of the table is 1.

Here, `Atomicity` states that a single cell cannot hold multiple values.It must hold only a single-valued attribute.

Before `1NF`

| Id | Name | Cell                  |
| -- | ---- | --------------------- |
| 1  | Raju | 9491879357/9122775511 |
| 2  | Rani | 9912984544            |

After `1NF`

| Id | Name | Cell       |
| -- | ---- | ---------- |
| 1  | Raju | 9491879357 |
| 1  | Raju | 9912984544 |
| 2  | Rani | 9912984544 |

### 2NF

Table already in 1NF and All Non-Key attributes are fully `functionally` dependent on Primary Key

Remove `partial functional` dependency

Before `2NF`

| customer_id | store_id | store_loc |
| ----------- | -------- | --------- |
| 1           | s1       | Mumbai    |
| 2           | s2       | Hyderabad |
| 3           | p1       | Chennai   |
| 4           | p2       | Pune      |
| 5           | p3       | Delhi     |

After `2NF`

| customer_id | store_id |
| ----------- | -------- |
| 1           | s1       |
| 2           | s2       |
| 3           | p1       |
| 4           | p2       |
| 5           | p3       |

| store_id | store_loc |
| -------- | --------- |
| s1       | Mumbai    |
| s2       | Hyderabad |
| p1       | Chennai   |
| p2       | Pune      |
| p3       | Delhi     |

### 3NF

A relation will be in `3NF` if it is in `2NF` and no `transition dependency` exists.

The `non-prime attributes,` which are not a part of the candidate key should not depend on other non-prime attributes in a table

Before `3NF`

| id | name    | course_id | course |
| -- | ------- | --------- | ------ |
| 1  | Ammit   | S21       | SQL    |
| 2  | Vennela | P21       | Python |
| 3  | Vivek   | S21       | SQL    |
| 4  | Prasad  | S21       | Python |

After `3NF`

| id | name    | course_id |
| -- | ------- | --------- |
| 1  | Ammit   | S21       |
| 2  | Vennela | P21       |
| 3  | Vivek   | S21       |
| 4  | Prasad  | S21       |

| course_id | course |
| --------- | ------ |
| S21       | SQL    |
| P21       | Python |

# Denormalization

It is an optimization strategy that is used after normalization has been achieved.

This method allows us to add redundant data into a normalized database to alleviate issues with database queries that merge data from several tables into a single table.

# ER Diagram

ER model stands for an Entity-Relationship model. It is a high-level data model. This model is used to define the data elements and relationship for a specified system.
